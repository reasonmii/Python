â˜… lists are mutable and tuples aren't

Lists: [1, 2, 3]
- Contained elements are mutable (can be changed after creation)
- Lists have a variable length
= A list takes up "more memory" than a tuple

Tuples: (1, 2, 3)
- Contained elements are immutable (cannot be changed after creation)
- Tuples have a fixed length
- A tuple takes up "less memory" than a list

When to use each one
- Lists provide a more accessible API
  and should be used "whenever similar types of objects need to be stored"
  and are "expected to change" over the course of the application's execution
- Tuples should be used for immutable data,
  behaving more like "constants" than "variables"
